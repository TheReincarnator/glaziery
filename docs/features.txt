Caching support to improve rendering on performance-critical applications like games.
Highly extensible and flexible, hierarchical windowing component architecture.
Strong separation of concerns:
- The component objects contain the state (models).
  Drawing is delegated from the components to the skin.
- The skin defines the layout, colors, bitmaps and the UI behavior of the components.
  Primitive drawing operations are delegated to the platform adapter.
- The platform adapter is the only part of Glaziery containing platform depending code.
  It performs primitive operations.
